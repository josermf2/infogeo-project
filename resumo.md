- **Aula_03_carteira.py**:

  - Centers on the topic of portfolio management using data imported from an Excel spreadsheet.
  - Demonstrates data manipulation techniques using Pandas, including indexing and filtering based on specific dates.

  **Concepts Used**:

  - **Pandas**: A data analysis and manipulation library employed for importing and transforming Excel datasets, with emphasis on time-series indexing. Pandas is particularly useful for cleaning, organizing, and analyzing large datasets, providing intuitive methods for manipulating time-indexed data that is common in financial studies.
  - **Portfolio Management**: Strategies for constructing and managing a portfolio of financial assets, focusing on optimizing returns while mitigating risk. Portfolio management involves asset selection, diversification, and rebalancing to maximize the expected return for a given level of risk.
- **Aula_03_sys_path.py**:

  - Demonstrates the modification of Python's system path (`sys.path`) to enable the importing of custom modules from non-standard directories.

  **Concepts Used**:

  - **`sys.path`**: A list in Python that indicates the directories the interpreter will search for modules, enabling custom module imports. This allows for modular programming, where custom-developed libraries can be used in different scripts without copying the code.
  - **Module Importing**: Extending the system path to incorporate user-defined libraries, facilitating modular programming and reuse of custom functions, which is essential for maintaining organized and efficient codebases.
- **Aula_04_fronteira_irrestrita.py**:

  - Discusses the construction of the unrestricted efficient frontier in portfolio theory.
  - Utilizes the custom `fin_emp` library for conducting optimization and risk-return trade-off analysis.

  **Concepts Used**:

  - **Efficient Frontier**: A fundamental concept in modern portfolio theory that identifies portfolios offering the highest expected return for a given level of risk. The efficient frontier represents the optimal set of portfolios, and constructing it involves solving optimization problems to identify combinations of assets that maximize return for a given risk.
  - **`fin_emp` Library**: A custom library that provides functions for calculating portfolio metrics and performing optimization tasks. This library encapsulates financial logic such as expected returns, variance, and covariance matrices, facilitating more streamlined analysis.
  - **Optimization**: The process of determining the optimal asset allocation to either maximize expected return or minimize risk. Optimization in finance often involves linear or quadratic programming to allocate resources in the most efficient manner.
- **Aula_05_fronteira_restrita.py & Aula_05_fronteira_restrita_20.py**:

  - Extends the analysis to the restricted efficient frontier by limiting the portfolio to the top 20 assets in the IBOVESPA index.
  - Introduces constraints to portfolio optimization, reflecting practical investment limitations.

  **Concepts Used**:

  - **Restricted Efficient Frontier**: An extension of the efficient frontier concept that incorporates additional investment constraints, such as limiting the number of assets in the portfolio. These constraints can reflect real-world considerations like liquidity, transaction costs, and regulatory requirements.
  - **Portfolio Constraints**: Restrictions applied to asset allocation, often due to regulatory or practical considerations. These constraints might include asset class caps, minimum and maximum allocation thresholds, or exclusion of specific securities due to ethical investing guidelines.
- **Aula_06_resumo.py**:

  - Provides a comprehensive exercise on calculating five-year returns for the 30 largest components of the IBOVESPA index.
  - Covers the calculation of both simple returns and annualized returns, emphasizing the interpretation of long-term investment performance.

  **Concepts Used**:

  - **Return Calculation**: Evaluating the percentage gain or loss of an investment over a specific period. Simple return provides a snapshot of an asset's performance over the period, while cumulative return reflects the total change.
  - **Annualized Return**: The compounded average rate of return per year over a given time period, reflecting the geometric mean of returns. Annualized returns allow for comparison across assets with different holding periods, providing a standardized measure of performance.
- **fin_emp.py**:

  - A custom-built library developed for the course, containing essential functions for:
    - **Portfolio Performance**: Calculation of expected return, variance, and other key metrics to evaluate portfolio outcomes.
    - **Optimization**: Leveraging SciPyâ€™s optimization algorithms to determine the optimal portfolio weights that balance risk and return.

  **Concepts Used**:

  - **Portfolio Performance**: Measurement of portfolio outcomes through metrics such as expected returns, volatility, and Sharpe ratio. Expected return measures the mean of potential outcomes, volatility measures the spread, and the Sharpe ratio provides a risk-adjusted return measure.
  - **SciPy**: A scientific library in Python that provides tools for mathematical optimization, used here to solve portfolio allocation problems. Optimization often involves minimizing a function (such as portfolio variance) subject to various constraints (like target returns or asset limits).
